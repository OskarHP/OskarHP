## Selected projects

### [Master's thesis in mathematical optimization](LINK)
An excerpt of my master's thesis, which I did in collaboration with Volvo Group in 2024. Multiple .py-files, as well as chapters, paragraphs and sentences in the thesis are removed (partly due to sensitive or irrelevant information).

### [Portfolio optimization and Energy finance](LINK)
Two group projects from the Course Computational Finance at Politecnico di Milano. In progress: Add code.
