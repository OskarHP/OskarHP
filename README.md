## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent **Master of Science in Engineering Mathematics** with a background mainly in mathematics, statistics, and programming.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,matlab,r,java,c)](https://skillicons.dev)
 

- **Math and statistics:** Stochastic processes, Fourier and complex analysis, ODE/PDE/SDE, Bayesian inference. 
- **Optimization:** Linear, nonlinear, integer and stochastic optimization. JuMP with Julia & Gurobi.  
- **Data science & Machine learning:** Data analysis, time series, statistical modelling, machine learning, brief deep learning (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, pytorch).
- **Simulation and High performance computing:** Monte Carlo simulation, Finite element methods, parallel programming.

## Selected projects

### [Master's thesis in mathematical optimization](https://github.com/OskarHP/Academic-Projects/tree/main/Master's%20thesis)
An excerpt of my master's thesis, which I did in collaboration with Volvo Group in 2024. Multiple .py-files, as well as chapters, paragraphs and sentences in the thesis are removed (partly due to sensitive or irrelevant information).

### [Portfolio optimization and Energy finance](https://github.com/OskarHP/Academic-Projects/tree/main/Computational%20finance)
Two group projects from the Course Computational Finance at Politecnico di Milano. In progress: Add code.

### [Bachelor's thesis in financial modelling](https://github.com/AliAlladin/TradingBot-DATX02-VT22)
(In Swedish) Group collaboration where we developed an algorithmic trading robot, focusing on long-term investments. My work was mainly on the algorithms, which included pair trading and fibonacci retracements, and backtesting of these. External repository.
